# DEPRECATED
This is no longer going to be developed.⛔️
The current application is a bit of a depdency mess, and has a lot of experimental code that is out of date. This was originally created as an WPF .netframework app, and in order to switch over to .NET Core, this original project has to be deprecated. The intention with creating this application was to learn and experiment, which I've managed to accomplish. The updated application is going to be called Too-many-Things, which should serve the same purpose.

 DEPRECATED ⛔️ Legacy description:
 Simple WPF app to keep track of checklists.
